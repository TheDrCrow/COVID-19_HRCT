<p><em><strong>At the time of writing the literature on SARS-Cov-2 infection is dominated by small descriptive studies mostly coming out of Wuhan in China. There are significant differences in age (average in many papers = 40 to 50yrs), background morbidity, medical practice and culture which will alter how this disease will present, be interpreted and will probably alter what the findings on radiology are. So, don't expect our experience over the next few months to be the same.</strong></em></p>

<li>73% of positives on Corona Princess were asymptomatic but 53% of these had ground glass opacities on CT Chest.</li>

<li>Raised LDH</li>
<li>Raised CRP</li>
<li>Low lymphocytes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="timescales">Timescales</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mild: generally resolve over 1/52. (cough can be many weeks)</li>
<li>Severe cases: generally progress over 7-10 days. Many will be in ITU at this point.</li>
<li>90% of deaths are from 10th to 28th day; peaking at Day 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes on HRCT are described soon after onset, so we may expect to see abnormalities on most of the referral but only 55% of patients had abnormalities on HRCT from day 0-2 of infection.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cxr-features">CXR features</h2>
<p>These will be the first investigation and there is NO direct to HRCT!</p>
<p>The role is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the other causes of acute SoB.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lobar, or at least unilateral consolidation and other features of infection . <em>Covid-19 is rarely simultaneously obvious AND unilateral.</em></li>
<li>Pneumothorax. <em>Should be obvious.</em></li>
<li>Pulmonary oedema. <em>Pleural effusions are unusual in Covid-19 infection and rare at presentation as are marked interstitial changes.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positively identify the classical features of Covid-19 infection.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patchy, bilateral airspace changes</li>
<li>Mostly subtle as more ground glass than consolidation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined with a decent history and other predictive elements ( Lymphopenia and / or Fever ) this has an adequate post-test probability to move straight into isolation without the need for a CT .<br>
This leaves a large group of patients with normal CXRs and good histories or patients with reasonable or good histories and some, but not specific CXR findings. For instance infective exacerbation of COPD. These patients will need an HRCT.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="file:///s:\Radiology\Shared Medical Imaging\Covid-19_HRCT\images%5Ccovid_cxr_faint_airspace.jpg" alt="Faint patchy airspace opacities at presentation"></p>
<p><em>CXR in patient presenting with Covid-19 infection - note the patchy, ill-defined, mostly peripheral regions of increased attenuation worse on the right than the left.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hrct">HRCT</h2>
<p>Non contrast is better but the changes are not so subtle we will err if we give contrast. Scan the whole chest as a volume as per the protocols. CT chest has been added to all the acute abdomen work to spot the occult / atypical Covid-19. These patients are high risk to staff in the operating theatre and there is a suggestion they are at higher risk as well.</p>
<h3 id="classical-features-at-presentation"><strong>Classical Features at presentation.</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>CLASSICAL APPEARANCES</strong> of an HRCT of a patient presenting with COVID-19 infection are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ground-glass opacities :</p>
<ul>
<li>Small and patchy &gt; Large and Solitary</li>
<li>Basal &gt; Apical and Posterior &gt; Anterior.</li>
<li>Consolidation - nearly always in combination with the ground-glass opacities, rarely on its own.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Err that is about it in terms of 'classical features' . Without ground-glass / mixed opacities it is unlikely to be Covid-19 and of course there are multiple virus and other pathogens and insults that can cause this so it is non-specific.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="file:///s:\Radiology\Shared Medical Imaging\Covid-19_HRCT\images%5Ccovid_CT_moderate_airspace_opacities.jpg" alt="Classical CT at presentation"></p>
<p><em>Typical CT at presentation with moderate size airspace opacities, which are bilateral, basal and mostly peripheral.</em></p>
<p>Then there are <strong>NOT-CLASSICAL APPEARANCES</strong> or occasional features often seen further into the course of the illness.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reticulation in association with the nodules</li>
<li>Round opacities &gt; linear opacities</li>
<li>Vascular prominence.</li>
<li>Crazy-paving / Perilobular changes.</li>
<li>Reverse Halo / Atoll sign - though this is rare.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then there are the <strong>NOT</strong> signs may not be related to COVID-19 and may push the differential toward something else.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cavitation</li>
<li>Pleural effusion</li>
<li>Thoracic lymphadenopathy</li>
<li>Bronchial wall thickening is seen in a minority but mostly late and might be chronic.</li>
<li>Widespread fibrosis.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NB</strong> <br>
Background changes ( emphysema, fibrosis etc ) are common and might predict worse prognosis. <br>
The literature on the 'occasional' findings is heterogeneous.<br>
e.g. 'reticulation' - some papers say 0% at presentation, others 40 to 80%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="file:///s:\Radiology\Shared Medical Imaging\Covid-19_HRCT\images%5Ccovid_CT_small_airspace_lesions_small.jpg" alt="Subtle change at presentation"></p>
<p><em>CT at presentation demonstrating subtle change which progressed on subsequent CTs - if asymptomatic or mild and / or early in disease then the changes can be minimal.</em></p>
<p><img src="file:///s:\Radiology\Shared Medical Imaging\Covid-19_HRCT\images\covid_CT_#1_AJR.jpg" alt="Obvious change at presentation"></p>
<p><em>CT at presentation demonstrating more established change but slightly atypical change. Could call this perilobular or reversed halo. Subsequent CTs demonstrated more foci of ground glass opacity.</em></p>
<h3 id="change-over-time"><strong>Change over time.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Several papers now document changes out to a month.

<li>hampered by variability in practice, timings and record of findings as well as interpretation.</li>
<li>general description of both fatal and non-fatal severe infection is developing.</li>

<p><strong>Fatal and very severe infection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The changes here are not so well described.
<ul>
<li>Either the respiratory insult from the pneumonia is enough to cause death, often in the multi-morbid and frail.</li>
<li>or, Adult Respiratory Distress syndrome intervenes normally around or after day 10. Please see below for a description of ARDS.</li>
<li>other organs can also be involved in severe disease including small vessels of the heart and the myocardium itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CT changes associated with worse clinical status on admission include
<ul>
<li>Diffuse vs focal/multifocal distibution.</li>
<li>CT severity score ( = number of lobes x extent of lobe involvement)</li>
<li><em>architectural distortion, effusions, traction bronchiectasis are also described as predicting more severe disease</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thus, we might expect to describe severe, progressive disease in terms of:
<ul>
<li>Large volumes of abnormality either at presentation or follow up.</li>
<li>Development of new lesions after about day 10-14 - ? secondary infection or just progressive covid-19.</li>
<li>Failure of any sign of resolution after about 14-21 days</li>
<li>Development of signs of other pathology such as cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.</li>
