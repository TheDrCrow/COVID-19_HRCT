# Idiot's Guide to Covid-19 HRCT reporting.

***At the time of writing the literature on SARS-Cov-2 infection is dominated by small descriptive studies mostly coming out of Wuhan in China. There are significant differences in age (average in many papers = 40 to 50yrs), background morbidity, medical practice and culture which will alter how this disease will present, be interpreted and will probably alter what the findings on radiology are. So, don't expect our experience over the next few months to be the same.***

## **Clinical Features**
#### Symptoms and Signs

* Variable : Asymptomatic to ARDS with Multiorgan failure.
  * ~80% Mild
  * ~20% Need admission
  * ~5% Need ventilation
  * 73% of positives on Corona Princess were asymptomatic but 53% of these had ground glass opacities on CT Chest.
* Presenting Features:
  1. Common
     * Fever
     * Cough
     * Lethargy
  2. Less Common
     * Shortness of breath (normally develops after the cough / fever.)
     * Loss of Smell and / or Taste
     * Pain - can be muscular and / or headache.
     * Diarrhoea and vomiting.

* Predictors of severe illness / death
  * Age
  * Co-morbidities
    * Cardiovascular disease
    * Diabetes
    * Hypertension
    * Chronic respiratory disease
  * Sex M > F
  * _Raised BMI_
  * _Poor Functional Status_

* Clinical predictors of severe illness / death
  * low SaO2 on room air.
  * Raised LDH
  * Raised CRP 
  * Low lymphocytes


#### Timescales 

   * Mild: generally resolve over 1/52. (cough can be many weeks)
   * Severe cases: generally progress over 7-10 days. Many will be in ITU at this point.
   * 90% of deaths are from 10th to 28th day; peaking at Day 14.

Changes on HRCT are described soon after onset, so we may expect to see abnormalities on most of the referral but only 55% of patients had abnormalities on HRCT from day 0-2 of infection.

____

## **Presentation: CXR features**

These will be the first investigation and there is NO direct to HRCT!

The role is twofold:
1. Identify the other causes of acute SoB.
   * Lobar, or at least unilateral consolidation and other features of infection . _Covid-19 is rarely simultaneously obvious AND unilateral._
   * Pneumothorax. _Should be obvious._
   * Pulmonary oedema. _Pleural effusions are unusual in Covid-19 infection and rare at presentation as are marked interstitial changes._

2. Positively identify the classical features of Covid-19 infection.
   * Patchy, bilateral airspace changes
   * Mostly subtle as more ground glass than consolidation.  
   
   Combined with a decent history and other predictive elements ( Lymphopenia and / or Fever ) this has an adequate post-test probability to move straight into isolation without the need for a CT .  
   This leaves a large group of patients with normal CXRs and good histories or patients with reasonable or good histories and some, but not specific CXR findings. For instance infective exacerbation of COPD. These patients will need an HRCT.

![Faint patchy airspace opacities at presentation](images\covid_cxr_faint_airspace.jpg)

_CXR in patient presenting with Covid-19 infection - note the patchy, ill-defined, mostly peripheral regions of increased attenuation worse on the right than the left._


![Range of changes on plain film Wong et al Rad 2020](images\covid_CXR_types-of-change.jpg)


_CXRs demonstrating changes seen at presentation:<br> A= (patchy) consolidation 59% <br>B= pleural effusion 3% <br>C= perihilar distribution 12% <br>D= peripheral distribution 51%._

---

## **Presentation: HRCT**

  * Non contrast whole chest HRCT as per protocol.
  * With contrast is fine; changes are not so subtle.
  * Chest has been added to acute abdomen CT A/P as:
    * CoVID-19 can present with confusion / falls and be incidental.
    * Positive patients are high mortality risk but also high risk to the surgeons \& others in theatre.
  
### **Classical Features.**

1. Ground-glass opacities :  
   * Small and patchy > Large and Solitary  
   * Basal > Apical and Posterior > Anterior.  
   * Consolidation - nearly always in combination with the ground-glass opacities, rarely on its own.  
  
2. Err that is about it in terms of 'classical features' . Without ground-glass / mixed opacities it is unlikely to be Covid-19 and of course there are multiple virus and other pathogens and insults that can cause this so it is non-specific. 

![Classical CT at presentation](images\covid_CT_moderate_airspace_opacities.jpg) 

_Typical CT at presentation with moderate size airspace opacities, which are bilateral, basal and mostly peripheral._  


Then there are **NOT-CLASSICAL APPEARANCES** or occasional features often seen further into the course of the illness.

1. Reticulation in association with the nodules
1. Round opacities > linear opacities
2. Vascular prominence. 
3. Crazy-paving / Perilobular changes. 
4. Reverse Halo / Atoll sign - though this is rare.

Then there are the **NOT** signs may not be related to COVID-19 and may push the differential toward something else.

1. Cavitation 
2. Pleural effusion
3. Thoracic lymphadenopathy
4. Bronchial wall thickening is seen in a minority but mostly late and might be chronic. 
5. Widespread fibrosis.

>**NB** <br>
> Background changes ( emphysema, fibrosis etc ) are common and might predict worse prognosis. <br>
> The literature on the 'occasional' findings is heterogeneous.<br>
>   e.g. 'reticulation' - some papers say 0% at presentation, others 40 to 80%. 

![Subtle change at presentation](images\covid_CT_small_airspace_lesions_small.jpg)
 
_CT at presentation demonstrating subtle change which progressed on subsequent CTs - if asymptomatic or mild and / or early in disease then the changes can be minimal._

![Obvious change at presentation](images/covid_CT_#1_AJR.jpg)

_CT at presentation demonstrating more established change but slightly atypical change. There is certainly reticulation and one could mention perilobular or reversed halo. Subsequent CTs demonstrated more foci of ground glass opacity._

---

## **Change over time.**
 
  - Several papers now document changes out to a month. 
    - hampered by variability in practice, timings and record of findings as well as interpretation.
    - general description of both fatal and non-fatal severe infection is developing.


**Non-fatal progression and resolution of severe infection**  

| Phase | Days | Findings |
| ------ |-----|-------|
|Early | 0-4 | None ( esp 0-2 days)<br>Low volume, subpleural, lower lobe GGOs.<br>Unilateral or bilateral|
|Progressive | 5-8 | Rapid increase in size and number to bilateral multilobed with diffuse GGO.<br>Consolidation and crazy-paving described.
|Peak | 9-13 | No new lesions.<br>Increase in attenuation in lesions now with dense consolidation<br>Crazy-paving and parenchymal bands more common.|
|Absorption | 14-28 | Gradual resorption of consolidation.<br>Appears to be more GGO as the consolidation reduces.<br>No crazy paving.|

90% + of scans carried out at Day 24-28 will be abnormal - mostly still some airspace change. 

![CT demonstrating a moderate pneumonia with resolution, Pan et al Radiol 2020 in press ](images\covid_CT_resolution-series_AJR.jpg)

_CT series of a 47yo female demonstrating the changes and resolution of a covid-19 infection.<br> A= 3 days post onset, B = 7 days post onset, C = 11 days post onset with signs of improvement which is early, D= 20 days_

![CT pattern of resolution over time Wang et al Radiol in press](images\covid_CT_resolution_series2.jpg)

_CT series of a 35yo female with Covid-19 pneumonia.<br>A= Day 0, B= Day 5, C= Day 11, D= Day 15 post onset._

**Fatal and very severe infection**

 - The changes here are not so well described. Either:
   1. Pneumonia +/- other morbidities => Respiratory failure & Death 💀 Or, 
   2. Adult Respiratory Distress syndrome intervenes normally around or after day 10. Please see below for a description of ARDS.
      
      . Other organs can also be involved in severe disease including small vessels of the heart and the myocardium itself.

 - CT changes associated with worse clinical status on admission include
   - Diffuse vs focal/multifocal distibution.
   - CT severity score ( = number of lobes x extent of lobe involvement)
   - _architectural distortion, effusions, traction bronchiectasis are also described as predicting more severe disease_  
 - Thus, we might expect to describe severe, progressive disease in terms of:
   - Large volumes of abnormality either at presentation or follow up.
   - Development of new lesions after about day 10-14 - ? secondary infection or just progressive covid-19.
   - Failure of any sign of resolution after about 14-21 days
   - Development of signs of other pathology such as cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.

## **Not such important stuff.**
 - lots of terminology is banded around which can lead to confusion:

#### Reticulation
   - If, you look closely at the areas of ground glass there will be really tiny lines in them (intralobular) or slightly bigger hexagonal shapes or lines (interlobular).
   - the literature is variable in the frequency and timing of reticulation so don't fret over it. 

#### Vascular Enlargement
- not an easy thing to call, would not worry about it.
- not really described with other pathologies and not an established fact. ![vascular enlargement](images\covid_CT_vascular-enlargement_AJR.jpg)

_hmm, yeah clearly that vessel is larger than I expect it to be_ 🤔

#### Crazy Paving
- is ground glass defined by thickened interlobular septa usually with intralobular septal thickening as well.
- fairly common in mid to late phase disease.

    ![crazypaving](images/crazy-paving_Rad.jpg)

#### Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome / Diffuse Alveolar Damage
  * Or, as they are better known, ARDS and DAD are essentially the same thing with DAD being the pathological findings which define the clinical syndrome, ARDS.
  * End point of a range of major insults (not just CoVID) which include infections, trauma, sepsis. 
   
      ![ARDS](images\aip_Rad.jpg)
  * 3 Stages: 
    * EXUDATIVE: alveoli become oedematous then necrosis with haemorrhage.
    * PROLIFERATIVE: 1/52-1/12: Type II pneumocytes invade and proliferate and produce collagen.
    * FIBROTIC: >1/12: reduction in infiltrate left with interstitial fibrosis. 
  * Radiology - follows the pathology a bit but mostly lots of ground-glass with dependent regions being more consolidative. So not really distinguishable from a severe infection. Pulmonary oedema generally has more interstitial lines in the acute phase.
  * Intensive care clinicians are the best at diagnosing this( sure I saw a mention of a paper recently where their clinical opinion outperformed an ML model ) and will probably tell you this on the form - or at least hint. 

#### Organising Pneumonia 
- utterly confusing terminology used here to describe an HRCT appearance but elsewhere is used to describe a pathological finding which is associated with several different insults (infection, collagen vascular disease, hypersensitivity) and clinical syndromes.
- best through of as 'pneumonia that has organised' - so it has been there for a bit and changed in some way - and best described as 'organising pneumonia pattern' or 'picture'. It is generally appreciated in COVID-19 infection some days after symptom onset.  

    ![organising pneumonia](images/organising-pneumonia_Rad.jpeg)

- generally it consists of peripheral airspace change which can be peribronchial, often associated with certain shapes so 'rounded' or ' linear'and distributions such as perilobular as well as unusual patterns such as reversed halo or atoll signs. (see below)

#### Perilobular 
- describes changes around the border of the secondary lobule which exceed the linear thickening seen with 'interlobular thickening
- mostly due to changes around the outer edge of the lobule rather than changes in the interlobular septum.
  
    ![perilobular changes](images/perilobular-organising-pneumonia.jpeg)

- seen in covid-19 as part of 'organising pneumonia pattern'

#### Reversed Halo and Atolls
- describe the same phenomenon and consist of normal (or less abnormal) lung surrounded by consolidative lung which is either a ring (=halo) or not quite complete (=atoll).
- seen in Covid-19 as part of the 'organising pneumonia picture'.

  ![reversed halo](images/covid_CT_reversed-halo_AJR.jpg)
  
#### Bandlike changes & Dependent changes.
- can be confusing and tricky to say if an abnormality in a dependent part of lung is due to dependency or real pathology at the best of times. 
- made all the more confusing by some literature referring to 'bandlike' opacities in Covid-19.

    ![bandlike COvid](images/covid_CT_band-like-opacity_BSTI.jpg)

    _bandlike opacity in the posterior right lung in a Covid-19 patient: note no volume loss, well defined focal lesion_

    ![dependent change](images/subpleural_dependent_atelectasis.jpeg)

    _dependent change: note more linear and wider distributed with some volume loss_
