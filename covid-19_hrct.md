# Idiot's Guide to Covid-19 HRCT reporting.

***At the time of writing the literature on SARS-Cov-2 infection is dominated by small descriptive studies mostly coming out of Wuhan in China. There are significant differences in age (average in many papers = 40 to 50yrs), background morbidity, medical practice and culture which will alter how this disease will present, be interpreted and will probably alter what the findings on radiology are. So, don't expect our experience over the next few months to be the same.***

## Clinical Features
#### Symptoms and Signs

* Variable : Asymptomatic to ARDS with Multiorgan failure.
  * ~80% Mild
  * ~20% Need admission
  * ~5% Need ventilation
  * 73% of positives on Corona Princess were asymptomatic but 53% of these had ground glass opacities on CT Chest.
* Presenting Features:
  1. Common
     * Fever
     * Cough
     * Lethargy
  2. Less Common
     * Shortness of breath (normally develops after the cough / fever.)
     * Loss of Smell and / or Taste
     * Pain - can be muscular and / or headache.
     * Diarrhoea and vomiting.

* Predictors of severe illness / death
  * Age
  * Co-morbidities
    * Cardiovascular disease
    * Diabetes
    * Hypertension
    * Chronic respiratory disease
  * Sex M > F
  * _Raised BMI_
  * _Poor Functional Status_

* Clinical predictors of severe illness / death
  * low SaO2 on room air.
  * Raised LDH
  * Raised CRP 
  * Low lymphocytes


#### Timescales 

   * Mild: generally resolve over 1/52. (cough can be many weeks)
   * Severe cases: generally progress over 7-10 days. Many will be in ITU at this point.
   * 90% of deaths are from 10th to 28th day; peaking at Day 14.

Changes on HRCT are described soon after onset, so we may expect to see abnormalities on most of the referral but only 55% of patients had abnormalities on HRCT from day 0-2 of infection.

## CXR features

These will be the first investigation and there is NO direct to HRCT!

The role is twofold:
1. Identify the other causes of acute SoB.
   * Lobar, or at least unilateral consolidation and other features of infection . _Covid-19 is rarely simultaneously obvious AND unilateral._
   * Pneumothorax. _Should be obvious._
   * Pulmonary oedema. _Pleural effusions are unusual in Covid-19 infection and rare at presentation as are marked interstitial changes._

2. Positively identify the classical features of Covid-19 infection.
   * Patchy, bilateral airspace changes
   * Mostly subtle as more ground glass than consolidation.  
   
   Combined with a decent history and other predictive elements ( Lymphopenia and / or Fever ) this has an adequate post-test probability to move straight into isolation without the need for a CT .  
   This leaves a large group of patients with normal CXRs and good histories or patients with reasonable or good histories and some, but not specific CXR findings. For instance infective exacerbation of COPD. These patients will need an HRCT.

## HRCT

Non contrast is better but the changes are not so subtle we will err if we give contrast. Scan the whole chest as a volume as per the protocols. CT chest has been added to all the acute abdomen work to spot the occult / atypical Covid-19. These patients are high risk to staff in the operating theatre and there is a suggestion they are at higher risk as well.

#### Classical Features
The **CLASSICAL APPEARANCES** of an HRCT with COVID-19 infection are:   

1. Ground-glass opacities :  
   * Small and patchy > Large and Solitary  
   * Basal > Apical and Posterior > Anterior.  
   * Consolidation - nearly always in combination with the ground-glass opacities, rarely on its own.  
  
2. Err that is about it in terms of 'classical features' . Without ground-glass / mixed opacities it is unlikely to be Covid-19 and of course there are multiple virus and other pathogens and insults that can cause this so it is non-specific. 

![Classical CT at presentation](images\covid_CT_moderate_airspace_opacities.jpg) 

_Typical CT at presentation with moderate size airspace opacities, which are bilateral, basal and mostly peripheral._  


Then there are **NOT-CLASSICAL APPEARANCES** or sometimes features often seen further into the course of the illness.

1. Reticulation in association with the nodules
1. Round opacities > linear opacities
2. Vascular prominence. 
3. Crazy-paving / Perilobular changes. 
4. Reverse Halo / Atoll sign - though this is rare.

Then there are the **NOT** signs which are infrequently seen may not be related to COVID-19 and may push the differential toward something else.

1. Cavitation 
2. Pleural effusion
3. Thoracic lymphadenopathy
4. Bronchial wall thickening is seen in a minority but mostly late and might be chronic. 
5. Widespread fibrosis.

Remember that chronic lung disease does not protect patients from infection but predicts them being sicker and thus more likely to be ill. 

The literature on CT findings is heterogeneous, especially in relation to 'subtle' early findings: some papers don't assess it, others say it is 0% whilst others state figures of 50% even at presentation. It must depend on how hard you look and what your definition is, so don't fret over it.

_CT at presentation demonstrating subtle change which progressed on subsequent CTs - if asymptomatic or mild and / or early in disease then the changes can be minimal._

![Obvious change at presentation](images/covid_CT_#1_AJR.jpg)

_CT at presentation demonstrating more established change but slightly atypical change. Could call this perilobular or reversed halo. Subsequent CTs demonstrated progression._
