<h3 id="clinical-features">Clinical Features</h3>
<h4 id="symptoms-and-signs">Symptoms and Signs</h4>
<p>Covid-19 produces a range of clinical syndromes from <em>asymptomatic</em> through to <em>ARDS</em>. From the perspective of HRCT reporting it is the viral pneumonia that predominates though we must be mindful of how these crossover into other HRCT patterns and how other organs ( especially the heart can be effected ).<br>
Presenting Features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Common
<ol>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Lethargy</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Less Common
<ol>
<li>Loss of Smell and / or Taste</li>
<li>Shortness of breath (normally seen later)</li>
<li>Diarrhoea and vomiting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most mild cases will recover over a week or so, the cough can continue for weeks without being infective. Progressive cases generally worsen due to worsening respiratory failure and death is due to ARDS picture with increasing interest in the effect in the heart.<br>
The interplay between the immune system and the infection seems to play an important but, as yet, not clear role in mediating the severity and prognosis of infection.</p>
<h4 id="timescales">Timescales</h4>
<p>Admission to hospital occurs on average the 10th day of illness and about 90% of deaths are from the 10th to 28th day after symptom onset.</p>
