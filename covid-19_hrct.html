<h3 id="clinical-features">Clinical Features</h3>
<h4 id="symptoms-and-signs">Symptoms and Signs</h4>
<p>Covid-19 produces a range of clinical syndromes from <em>asymptomatic</em> through to <em>ARDS</em>. From the perspective of HRCT reporting it is the viral pneumonia that predominates though we must be mindful of how these crossover into other HRCT patterns and how other organs ( especially the heart can be affected ).<br>
Presenting Features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Common
<ol>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Lethargy</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Less Common
<ol>
<li>Loss of Smell and / or Taste</li>
<li>Pain - can be muscular and / or headache.</li>
<li>Shortness of breath (normally follows after the cough / fever. )</li>
<li>Diarrhoea and vomiting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most mild cases will recover over a week or so, the cough can continue for weeks without being infective. Progressive cases generally worsen due to worsening respiratory failure and death is due to ARDS picture with increasing interest in the effect in the heart.<br>
The interplay between the immune system and the infection seems to play an important but, as yet, not clear role in mediating the severity and prognosis of infection.</p>
<h4 id="timescales">Timescales</h4>
<p>Admission to hospital occurs on average the 10th day of illness and about 90% of deaths are from the 10th to 28th day after symptom onset.
Changes on HRCT are described soon after onset, so we may expect to see abnormalities on most of the referral but only xxx % of patients had abnormalities on HRCT from day 0-2 of infection.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="cxr-features">CXR features</h3>
<p>These will be the first investigation and there is NO direct to HRCT!</p>
<p>The role is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the other causes of acute SoB.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lobar, or at least unilateral consolidation. <em>Covid-19 is rarely simultaneously obvious AND unilateral</em></li>
<li>Pneumothorax. <em>should be obvious</em></li>
<li>Pulmonary oedema. <em>pleural effusions are unusual in Covid-19 infection and rare at presentation as are marked interstitial changes</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positively identify the classical features of Covid-19 infection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patchy, bilateral airspace changes</li>
<li>Mostly subtle as more ground glass than consolidation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Combined with a decent history and other predictive elements ( Lymphopenia and / or Fever ) this has an adequate post-test probability to move straight into isolation without the need for a CT .<br>
This leaves a large group of patients with normal CXRs and good histories or patients with reasonable or good histories and some, but not specific CXR findings. For instance infective exacerbation of COPD. These patients will need an HRCT.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="hrct">HRCT</h3>
<p>Non contrast is better but the changes are not so subtle we will err if we give contrast. Scan the whole chest as a volume as per the protocols. CT chest has been added to all the acute abdomen work to spot the occult / atypical Covid-19. These patients are high risk to staff in the operating theatre and there is a suggestion they are at higher risk as well.</p>
<h4 id="classical-features">Classical Features</h4>
<p>The <strong>CLASSICAL APPEARANCES</strong> of an HRCT with COVID-19 infection are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ground-glass opacities :<br>
a. Small and patchy &gt; Large and Solitary<br>
b. Basal &gt; Apical and Posterior &gt; Anterior.<br>
c. Consolidation - nearly always in combination with the ground-glass opacities, rarely on its own.</li>
<li>err that is about it in terms of 'classical features' . Without ground-glass / mixed opacities it is unlikely to be Covid-19 and of course there are multiple virus and other pathogens and insults that can cause this so it is non-specific.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then there are <strong>NOT-CLASSICAL APPEARANCES</strong> or sometimes features often seen further into the course of the illness.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reticulation in association with the nodules</li>
<li>Round opacities &gt; linear opacities</li>
<li>Vascular prominence.</li>
<li>Crazy-paving / Perilobular changes.</li>
<li>Reverse Halo / Atoll sign - though this is rare.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then there are the <strong>NOT</strong> signs which are not known to be related to COVID-19 and may push the differential away from the</p>
<ol>
<li>Cavitation</li>
<li>Pleural effusion</li>
<li>Thoracic lymphadenopathy</li>
<li>Bronchial wall thickening is seen in a minority but mostly late and might be chronic.</li>
<li>Widespread fibrosis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that chronic lung disease does not protect patients from infection but predicts them being sicker and thus more likely to be ill.</p>
